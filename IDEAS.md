# Horror Puzzle Game
We can build a game from scratch using C#. The premise will be an escape style horror puzzle game where you have to find the solutions to problems to exit each room. We could have some sort of "thing" chasing you so you have to complete tasks in a specific order to leave without getting caught. This should probably be made 2D as I think that building a 3D game for our first time building a game in this language would be too much of a stretch. Building this sort of game with a top down view would be best. This could have lots of apsects that could be interesting such as: 
- Machine learning if you guys wanted to do that for the "thing" chasing you
- Puzzle design 
- Procedural generation (possibly), interesting from the algorithmic POV
- Horror game music and visuals are a whole interesting thing of their own 
- Building from scratch would definitly hit the complexity we would need
