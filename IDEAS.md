# Horror Puzzle Game
We can build a game from scratch using C#. The premise will be an escape style horror puzzle game where you have to find the solutions to problems to exit each room. We could have some sort of "thing" chasing you so you have to complete tasks in a specific order to leave without getting caught. This should probably be made 2D as I think that building a 3D game for our first time building a game in this language would be too much of a stretch. Building this sort of game with a top down view would be best. This could have lots of apsects that could be interesting such as: 
- Machine learning if you guys wanted to do that for the "thing" chasing you
- Puzzle design 
- Procedural generation (possibly), interesting from the algorithmic POV
- Horror game music and visuals are a whole interesting thing of their own 
- Building from scratch would definitly hit the complexity we would need

Tom's thoughts:
- Would absolutely love to do some machine learning things, would definitely be within our scope of skills and time plus a 2D implementation (even better a grid) would make it much easier to both run and develop some form of AI (excuse my buzzwording)
- I can already imagine making some sick noise propogation doohickey to take the "thing" out of its "patrol" state and into a "search" state (like having sound travel from grid-block to grid-block where a change from air to wall dampens propogation so it can wrap around corners and through thin walls)
- Plus our individual pursuits can just be developed in parallel and join up to make a really cool game! (and we can all say we've formed a small game development team which is a pretty cool bragging right in itself)
- As for language I am easy because I'm learning new things anyhow
- We need a cool group name :]

# 2025-02-07 notes (post-Steven)
- Writing a game in C not a great idea

## Language options
- C#
- C (no game)
- Java (depends on project vs Tom's experience)
- Rust (depends on James' experience)
- TypeScript
- Golang (please God no)

## Lucas preferences
- Something somewhat algorithmic
- Would be fun to do something that involves sound of some kind (not a dealbreaker though)
- Hesitant on AI
